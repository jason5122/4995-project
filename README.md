# Transfer Learning Project

This repository contains the code used to reproduce the findings in our paper. Both the CLIP model with thresholding and the hierarchical ensemble model can be found in `CLIP_Model.ipynb`. Within the `standalone` is Python-only code to run the CLIP model with thresholding and simple CNN.
